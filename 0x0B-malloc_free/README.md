[File 1-strdup.c](./1-strdup.c) is a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

[File 2-str_concat.c](./2-str_concat.c) is a function that concatenates two strings.

[File 3-alloc_grid.c](./3-alloc_grid.c) is a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

[File 4-free_grid.c](./4-free_grid.c) is a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by our alloc_grid function.

[File 100-argstostr.c](./100-argstostr.c) is a function that concatenates all the arguments of our program.

[File 101-strtow.c](./101-strtow.c) is a function that splits a string into words.

[File holberton.h](./holberton.h) is a header file contaning all the function prototypes.
